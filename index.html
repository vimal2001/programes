	In this article, you'll learn to divide your code base into clean, efficient modules using Python packages. Also, you'll learn to import and use your own or third party packages in a Python program.

 <h2>What are packages</h2>

 	We don't usually store all of our files on our computer in the same location. We use a well-organized hierarchy of directories for easier access.
    A package is basically a directory with Python files and a file with the name _init.py. This means that every directory inside of the Python path, which contains a file named __init_.py, will be treated as a package by Python.
    As our application program grows larger in size with a lot of modules, we place similar modules in one package and different modules in different packages. This makes a project (program) easy to manage and conceptually clear. 
    Similarly, as a directory can contain subdirectories and files, a Python package can have sub-packages and modules.

    A directory must contain a file named _init_.py in order for Python to consider it as a package. This file can be left empty but we generally place the initialization code for that package in this file.
